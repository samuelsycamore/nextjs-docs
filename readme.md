# Sam Sycamore Technical Writer Portfolio

This website was built using [Nextra](https://github.com/shuding/nextra), a unique "no-code" framework/theme built on top of Next.js.

Nextra allows me to compose all of my pages and posts in Markdown/MDX, and organize them in simple JSON metadata files that integrate seamlessly with Next's file-system based routing.

As a code-literate writer, I really appreciate being able to take a "docs as code" approach to this site by bringing the git workflow to my written content and doing all of my publishing directly through the terminal in my IDE.
