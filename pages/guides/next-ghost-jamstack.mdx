# Build a Jamstack Blog with Next.js, Ghost CMS, Vercel & Heroku
### March 8, 2021

![Van Gogh](/index.png)

### The purpose of this guide is to get you up and running as quickly as possible with a robust Jamstack blog. 

Our final product will be skeletal and austere but fully functional.

<Callout>
No time for a detailed walkthrough? Just need the source code? You can grab the final product we'll be building over on my [Github](https://github.com/samuelsycamore/van-gogh-stack). Have fun!
</Callout>

## Introducing the Van Gogh Stack

OK I'll admit it's silly, but I needed a catchy name so hear me out:

> **V**ercel + **N**ext.js + **G**host CMS + **H**eroku = **VNGH** *(read: "Van Gogh")*

**The Van Gogh Stack** is my preferred combo for building and deploying [Jamstack](https://www.jamstack.org) sites. It uses the [Next.js](https://www.nextjs.org) framework deployed to [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com) for the presentation layer, and [Ghost](https://ghost.org/docs) set up as a headless CMS on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) for the data layer.

It is 100% free to host and deploy, though Heroku will want credit card info from us, as we will see.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that you've already been convinced that the Jamstack is the coolest!

You should be familiar with React / Next.js and RESTful APIs.

You will need to know enough about git to push code to Github.

You don't need prior experience with Ghost, but it will make more sense if you've worked with other content management systems (especially headless) before.

## Set Up Heroku

To get started, we'll need to set up an account with [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com).

As soon as we're in, our next step is to head straight to the [Ghost on Heroku one-click installation](https://elements.heroku.com/buttons/snathjr/ghost-on-heroku). Scroll down that page until you find this lil beauty:

![Deploy on Heroku button](/deploy-button.png)

*(The true heroes of our story here are [SNathJr](https://github.com/SNathJr/ghost-on-heroku) and [cobyism](https://github.com/cobyism/ghost-on-heroku). They assuredly suffered for this magical one-click installation so that we might thrive. God bless 'em.)*

Give it a click and you'll land on a page that looks like this:

![New Ghost app on Heroku](/new-ghost-app.png)

You don't need to worry about most of the options on the form, but these two are required:

* **App Name** can be whatever you like.
* **APP_PUBLIC_URL** determines the future domain of your CMS: change YOURAPPNAME to whatever you want in ```https://YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com``` (don't worry too much about this URL, it will only be for you)

Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Deploy app**. It may take a few minutes while Heroku builds the CMS.

<Callout>
Note: if this is your first Heroku app, you will be asked to provide credit card information. I don't love it either, but their free tier is generous enough that you may not ever need to scale up to a paid plan even if you're seeing pretty significant traffic - that's part of the magic of the Jamstack.

And if you ever *do* need to scale up, [Ghost's documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/faq/clustering-sharding-multi-server/) recommends adding a content delivery network (CDN) into your stack rather than upgrading your CMS hosting (which should not be necessary). CDN integration is beyond the scope of this guide; just know that it is an option.
</Callout>

Once the build is complete, we're pretty much done with Heroku. Congratulations! That's 1 of 4 down in our Van Gogh stack.

## Configure Ghost

Now we can navigate to ```https://YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com/ghost``` to get our CMS up and running.

The first time you visit this page, you should see something like this:

![Ghost Setup](/ghost-welcome.png)

After you've completed the installation, you'll land on your shiny new Ghost CMS admin panel when visiting this same URL. Everything should be self-explanatory here:

![Ghost CMS](/ghost-boilerplate.png)

<Callout>
By default, Ghost ships with [Handlebars templates](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to render your posts on the server. But since we're planning to go headless, it really doesn't matter what the server-side template looks like, because we won't actually be serving it up to our visitors. Don't worry about the design here.
</Callout>

The basic installation includes a set of dummy posts that will save us the trouble of making our own to test our connection to Next.js, once we get there. We'll leave them alone for now, but when you're ready to replace them with your own content, you can make them all disappear quickly by deleting the author 'Ghost' in the **Staff** section.

![Delete Ghost author to remove dummy posts](/delete-ghost.png)

### Set CMS to Private

Navigate to **General** Settings and scroll down to the Advanced Settings at the bottom. Set your site to private and give it a password.

![Set your CMS to private](/advanced-private.png)

This won't have any effect on your future presentation layer - since we are using Ghost as a headless CMS, these settings only apply to the Heroku app where the CMS lives. Making the CMS private ensures that Google won't get it mixed up with your *canonical* front end and start sending people to the back end of your site instead.

### Add Custom Integration for API Key

In order for Ghost to communicate with our Next.js front end (coming soon!), we'll need to be able to access the RESTful API. 

Navigate to **Integrations** under Settings and click **+ Add custom integration**. Give it any name you like.

![Add custom integration](/custom-integration.png)

On the other side of the naming form, you'll find three important bits of information - but we really only need to worry about two:
* **Content API Key** - we will pass this string to our Next.js app to grab content from our CMS
* **API URL** - we'll also need to specify where the content is coming from over in our Next app

Hang onto this info for now. That's all we need to do to get the ball rolling with Ghost.

We're halfway there already! Pretty painless so far, right?

## Build Next.js App

*If you encounter any trouble during this stage in development, I would highly recommend referring to the [official Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/create-next-app), which is very thorough and well written. This will be a broad overview that assumes you're already familiar with the key features of Next.js.*

### Create a New Project

Fire up your terminal, ```cd``` to the folder where you want to create a new app, and run one of the following commands:

```bash
npx create-next-app
# or
yarn create next-app
```

<Callout>
Unless explicitly specified via the ```--use-npm``` flag, ```create-next-app``` defaults to Yarn.
</Callout>

You will be asked to give the project a name before the necessary packages start rolling in.

After installation is complete, you can ```cd``` into the new app's folder and run ```yarn dev``` or ```npm run dev``` to fire up the local development environment at ```http://localhost:3000```.

```create-next-app``` ships with a default landing page that looks like this:

![Default Next landing page](/create-next-app.png)

Yeehaw! We're making good progress now.

When we open up our new Next.js app in our IDE, we see it's pretty minimal to begin with:

![Next app in VSCode](/new-next-app.png)

Great! We really don't have to do much to hook this up to our CMS.

To simplify the process of receiving data from Ghost, we can install the official [JavaScript Ghost Content API helper](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/javascript/) by running:

```bash
yarn add @tryghost/content-api
# or
npm install @tryghost/content-api
```

According to Ghost's documentation:

> The library can be used in any JavaScript project, client or server side and abstracts away all the pain points of working with API data.

[Click here](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/javascript/) for more details.

Now, anytime we need to access our content data, we can ```import``` the helper to do some of the heavy lifting for us:

```jsx
import GhostContentAPI from '@tryghost/content-api'
```

### Accessing Content Data

Let's create a new folder in our root directory and call it ```lib```. Inside, create a new file called ```posts.js```. This file will hold the functions we need to pull in our content data from Ghost.

<Callout>
These files and folders can be named whatever you like, but it's a good idea to keep this ```posts.js``` file separate from your ```pages``` directory to prevent it from getting mixed in with content as your project grows.
</Callout>

Paste the following code into ```posts.js``` - be sure to swap in your details where appropriate:

```jsx
// lib/posts.js

import GhostContentAPI from "@tryghost/content-api";

// Create API instance with site credentials
const api = new GhostContentAPI({
  url: 'https://YOURAPPNAME.herokuapp.com',
  key: 'YOUR-GHOST-CONTENT-API-KEY',
  version: "v3"
});

// Grab all of our posts from Ghost
export async function getPosts() {
    return await api.posts
      .browse({
        limit: "all"
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.error(err);
      });
  }
  
  // Grab each individual post from Ghost
  export async function getSinglePost(postSlug) {
    return await api.posts
      .read({
        slug: postSlug
      })
      .catch(err => {
        console.error(err);
      });
  }
  ```

Let's break down what's going on here:
* Import the ```GhostContentAPI``` helper
* Create a new API instance
* Grab a list of all posts from Ghost
* Grab each individual post from Ghost

The ```posts.browse()``` and ```posts.read()``` endpoints accessed by those last two functions have [many parameters to choose from](https://ghost.org/docs/content-api/javascript/), but this boilerplate setup will be enough to get us started.

### Displaying All Blog Posts

Next, let's give ```index.js``` a makeover so it will show us a list of our blog posts. Wipe the slate clean and paste in the following code:

```jsx
// pages/index.js

import { getPosts } from "../lib/posts";
import Link from "next/link";

const Index = (props) => (
  <ul>
    {props.posts.map((post) => (
      <li key={post.id}>
        <Link href={`/posts/${post.slug}`}>
          <a>
            {post.title}
          </a>
        </Link>
      </li>
    ))}
  </ul>
);

export default Index;

export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const posts = await getPosts();

  if (!posts) {
    return {
      notFound: true,
    };
  }

  return {
    props: { posts },
    revalidate: 1000,
  };
}

```

Breaking it down:
* Import the ```getPosts``` function and Next's ```Link``` component
* Render a component that receives post data and maps it to individual list items
* Fetch all posts with ```getStaticProps()```, return ```props``` in the form of a ```posts``` object
* ```revalidate``` to look for new post data every 1000 seconds

The ```<Link />``` component is not yet functional because we still need to build the page that will serve up our individual posts. Let's do that now. 

### Rendering Individual Posts

In our ```pages``` directory, let's create a new folder named ```posts```. Inside, create a new file and name it ```[slug].js```.

<Callout>
The brackets in ```[slug].js``` are necessary to tell Next.js to treat this as a **dynamic route**. [Learn more about dynamic routes here](https://nextjs.org/docs/routing/dynamic-routes).
</Callout>

Paste the following code into ```[slug.js]```:

```jsx
// pages/posts/[slug].js

import { getSinglePost, getPosts } from '../lib/posts';

const PostPage = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={props.post.feature_image} />
      <h1>{props.post.title}</h1>
      <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: props.post.html }} />
    </div>
  )
}

export default PostPage;

export async function getStaticPaths() {
  const posts = await getPosts()

  // Get the paths we want to create based on posts
  const paths = posts.map((post) => ({
    params: { slug: post.slug },
  }))

  // "fallback: false" gives us a 404 if post not found
  return { paths, fallback: false }
}


// Pass the page slug over to the "getSinglePost" function
// In turn passing it to the posts.read() to query the Ghost Content API
export async function getStaticProps(context) {
  const post = await getSinglePost(context.params.slug)

  if (!post) {
    return {
      notFound: true,
    }
  }

  return {
    props: { post },
    revalidate: 1000
  }
}
```

This is the final piece of the puzzle that we need for a fully functional blog:
* Import ```getSinglePost``` & ```getPosts``` functions from ```posts.js```
* Render a component that displays a blog post's featured image, title, and HTML content 
* Create the slugs we need based on post data
* Tell ```getSinglePost``` to go get the post that corresponds to the given slug, which then queries the ```GhostContentAPI``` for it
* Return ```props```, ```revalidate``` every 1000 seconds

<Callout>
A note on ```dangerouslySetInnerHTML``` - the name is intended to be a reminder that this can be a dangerous way to operate. That said, this is the **preferred** way to render Ghost's content, and there's little risk of cross-site scripting attacks here.
</Callout>

And with that, our new Next.js front end should now be plugged into our headless Ghost CMS!

Before we get too excited, let's add one tiny fix to our CSS. We've asked Ghost to send over some images in our posts, but we haven't specified their dimensions, so they're going to be massive and unwieldy if we don't address that.

Paste this snippet into ```styles/globals.css``` as a quick fix:

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

This will ensure that the images play nice with the rest of the content in the posts.

Now, if we run ```yarn dev``` or ```npm run dev```, we should see something like this:

![Ghost connected to Next.js](/ghost-blog.png)

Isn't it beautiful? Truly a sight to behold! The fact that this data is now showing up on our front end means we've successfully integrated our decoupled layers. That's no small feat! 

If we click on any of the list items we should be taken to the corresponding dummy post. 

If you get hung up at this step, make sure that your directory names, slugs, props, and routing all line up correctly. I've tried to keep the demo project as skeletal as possible while still setting you up for an organized environment as you build it out from here.

We're approaching the finish line now, and the final step is really more like a victory lap after the marathon of setting up Next.js!

Go ahead and push your project to Github so we can get ready to deploy it.

## Deploy on Vercel

Sign up for an account with [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com) if you haven't already. Vercel (formerly Zeit) are the creators of Next.js, so their deployment platform is optimized for this framework right out of the gate.

Once you're in, click on the **New Project** button on your dashboard. Select the repo from your Github account, then step back and let Vercel work its magic.

If all goes according to plan, your site should build and deploy in no time:

![Site deployed on Vercel](/vercel-deployed.png)

Congratulations indeed! You just launched a fully functional blog using the Van Gogh Stack!

It's not much to look at just yet, but now you've got a very robust blank canvas and the sky's the limit!

Happy jamming, Jamstackers!! If and when you improve on what I've built here, be sure to [git at me on Github](https://github.com/samuelsycamore/van-gogh-stack)!
