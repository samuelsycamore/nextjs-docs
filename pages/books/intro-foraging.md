Interested in foraging, but feeling intimidated and unsure where to begin?

*Introduction to Foraging* was written with the absolute beginner in mind. Maybe you’re a gardener who’s curious about some of the common garden weeds you’ve heard are edible; perhaps you’re a hiker or wilderness enthusiast who’s interested in scoring some of the best trail snacks on Earth, for free. 

I created *Introduction to Foraging* to help you go from zero to hero in the world of wild foods this year -- consider it your remedial class in foraging before you head out to start gathering some of the most delicious, nutritious, and abundant treats under the sun.
