# Foraging North America
## The Botany, Taxonomy, and Ecology of Edible Wild Plants

![Foraging North America cover](/fna-cover.jpg)

**Foraging North America** is a 12-week course designed to arm you with a functional working knowledge of botany and taxonomy that you can take with you out onto the land to fast-track the ID process and boost your confidence when foraging.

First we review the basics of the science of plants; then we move on to explore some of the more common plant families around the world; and last but not least, we devote the final half of the course to a deep-dive on a dozen common edible wild plants found all across North America.

My mission in creating this program is to promote ecological literacy alongside an ethos of **conservation through use** — the (surprisingly) radical notion that humans can, in fact, have a positive impact on the environments that we move through. 

Nothing makes me happier than introducing people to the edible wild plant allies who surround us at all times.

Food is everywhere — you just need to know how to look, and how to describe what you see! That’s where this course comes in.
