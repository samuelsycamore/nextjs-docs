## Welcome

## Currently 
I'm working with local business owners to upgrade their web presence to modern standards. Here's what a [recent client](https://www.lyonscape.com) of mine had to say:

> "Sam did an amazing job updating and deploying my website. Sam operated start to finish with professionalism and integrity.
> My ideas and concerns were addressed and implemented in an artistic way and I couldn't be happier with the end result." 

## Previously
I've been involved with online startups as a freelance writer and editor since 2012.

In 2016 I launched my own lifestyle brand, *The Good Life Revival*. Through this venture I grew a listener-supported podcast to 5000+ downloads per month, 2000+ newsletter subscribers, and 20k+ monthly site visitors.

I taught botany and taxonomy to hundreds of people through my two books, *Foraging North America* (2019) and *Introduction to Foraging* (2018).

Here's what one of my students had to say after a mentorship program I ran:

> "Sam's guidance is a key reason that I now feel able to walk outside on any given day and forage some wild items for a meal. 
> Sam's approach is fun, casual and friendly, but don't confuse casual for lightweight. 
> The thing is, he is so well educated about plants that he is able to translate complex vocabulary and a very deep understanding into simple, manageable lessons for those of us who are newer to the topic."

## Education

I graduated from the University of Louisville in 2012 as a triple major in Biology, Philosophy, and French.
